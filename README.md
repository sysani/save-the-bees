# Environmental Initiative: Bee Colony Decline

Bees play an important role in our ecosystem, by pollinating flowers and enabling the fertilization and production of seeds. Bee pollination is important to the agricultural industry as well, with bee pollination supplying one third of the world’s crop production [1].

However, over the past half century, the number of bee colonies worldwide has seen a decline. Though no exact source of the decline has been discovered, possible causes include parasites, disease, pesticides, and the decrease in wildflowers [2]. Bees, both wild and domestic, are necessary to keep our ecosystem in balance and to aid in crop development. Without them, we could face crop decline, increase in food prices, and numerous environmental issues.

Initiative Designed to Address It:

My initiative aims to address the problem of the declining bee population with 3 steps that anyone can take part in.

1.	Avoid the use of pesticides

Bees rely on early spring weeds, such as dandelions, as a source of food before later-season plants begin sprouting. Pesticides can not only destroy a bee’s source of food but poison bees as well. My initiative would create an educational awareness campaign for landscapers and gardeners to wait until mid-spring when later plants begin to bloom before removing flowering weeds, and make sure pesticides used are safe for bees.

2.	Plant local fauna & wildflowers

My initiative will provide home gardeners, city landscapers and businesses with local plants that attract bees, to provide them with a food source.

3.	Support local beekeepers

Beekeepers provide bees with a hives for shelter and production of honey. They are able to keep track of the hives and prevent mites, diseases, or predators from killing bees. My initiative would set aside part of the money to be provided to beekeepers, to allow them to continue keeping the number of bee colonies stable.


**Dataset:**
Included in my initiative is a dataset of colony numbers in the United States from 1987 – 2017 [3]. I plan to aggregate the total for all states per year in order to model the declining trend in the US and predict the future colony numbers.
